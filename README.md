# edna-s-react-portfolio

The following code is for my portfolio built using ReactJS. The portfolio opens to a page with an image of myself as well as a section about me. There is a navbar with links to other pages with my portfolio, a contact form and my resume. The portfolio also includes a footer with links to my linkedIn, gmail and github.
